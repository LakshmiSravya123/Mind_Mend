# Manual GitHub Setup for MoodSync

Since Git operations are restricted in this environment, here's how to manually set up your GitHub repository:

## Method 1: Using GitHub's Web Interface (Easiest)

### Step 1: Download Your Project
1. In Replit, click the three dots menu (â‹¯) next to "Files"
2. Select "Download as ZIP"
3. Extract the ZIP file on your computer

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon and select "New repository"
3. Repository name: `moodsync`
4. Description: `AI-powered health companion for mood analysis and wellness tracking`
5. Choose Public or Private
6. **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README" (we already have one)
7. Click "Create repository"

### Step 3: Upload Files via GitHub Web Interface
1. On your new empty repository page, click "uploading an existing file"
2. Drag and drop all your extracted project files
3. Scroll down to commit section
4. Title: `Initial commit: MoodSync AI health companion`
5. Description: Add this detailed description:
   ```
   - Complete health monitoring and mood analysis platform
   - AI-powered mood detection from biometric data using GPT-4o
   - Real-time health metrics tracking (heart rate, sleep, steps, stress)
   - Interactive mood timeline with visual charts
   - AI chat companion for wellness support
   - Personalized insights and recommendations
   - Modern React frontend with TypeScript
   - Express backend with OpenAI integration
   ```
6. Click "Commit new files"

## Method 2: Using Git Commands (If you have Git access locally)

If you download the files and have Git on your local machine:

```bash
# Navigate to your extracted project folder
cd path/to/your/moodsync-project

# Initialize Git (if not already done)
git init

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/moodsync.git

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit with detailed message
git commit -m "feat: initial commit - MoodSync AI health companion

- Complete health monitoring and mood analysis platform
- AI-powered mood detection from biometric data using GPT-4o
- Real-time health metrics tracking (heart rate, sleep, steps, stress)
- Interactive mood timeline with visual charts
- AI chat companion for wellness support
- Personalized insights and recommendations
- Modern React frontend with TypeScript
- Express backend with OpenAI integration
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components"

# Set main branch and push
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Method 3: Using GitHub CLI (Advanced)

If you have GitHub CLI installed:

```bash
# Navigate to project folder
cd path/to/your/moodsync-project

# Create repository directly
gh repo create moodsync --public --description "AI-powered health companion for mood analysis and wellness tracking"

# Add and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: MoodSync AI health companion"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Post-Upload Setup

Once your code is on GitHub:

### 1. Configure Repository Settings
- Go to your repository settings
- Add topics/tags: `ai`, `health`, `mood-analysis`, `react`, `typescript`, `openai`, `wellness`
- Set up branch protection for main branch (optional)

### 2. Verify Files
Make sure these files are visible in your repository:
- [ ] README.md
- [ ] LICENSE
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md
- [ ] .env.example
- [ ] .gitignore
- [ ] package.json
- [ ] All source code files

### 3. Update Repository URLs
Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` in any documentation with your actual GitHub username.

## Environment Variables for Deployment

When deploying to platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or Railway:

1. **Required Environment Variable:**
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key

2. **Optional Environment Variables:**
   - `NODE_ENV`: Set to `production`
   - `PORT`: Usually auto-set by hosting platforms

## Deployment Platforms

### Vercel (Recommended)
1. Connect your GitHub repository
2. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
3. Deploy automatically

### Netlify
1. Connect your GitHub repository
2. Build command: `npm run build`
3. Publish directory: `dist`
4. Add environment variables

### Railway
1. Connect your GitHub repository
2. Add environment variables
3. Auto-deploy on push

### Render
1. Connect your GitHub repository
2. Build command: `npm run build`
3. Start command: `npm start`
4. Add environment variables

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Large file uploads**: GitHub web interface has file size limits. Use Git command line for large files.
2. **Missing files**: Ensure all project files are included in the upload.
3. **Environment variables**: Never commit .env files with real API keys.

### File Structure Verification:
Your repository should have this structure:
```
moodsync/
â”œâ”€â”€ client/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ server/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ shared/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ schema.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
â”œâ”€â”€ CONTRIBUTING.md
â””â”€â”€ .env.example
```
